Management, DBMS-RDBMS

-->  SQL is Structured Query Language, is the standard language used for interacting with relational databases. It is used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data        stored in databases.

SQL is both a data definition language (DDL) and a data manipulation language (DML). It provides commands to:

Create and modify database structures (tables, views, indexes).

Insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

Define access permissions and transaction control.

Definition of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform operations such as:

Creating and modifying database schemas (DDL).

Performing queries to fetch data (DQL).

Inserting, updating, and deleting data (DML).

Granting user permissions and managing transactions (DCL and TCL).

Importance of SQL in Database Management
SQL plays a critical role in Database Management Systems (DBMS) due to the following reasons:

✅ Data Retrieval
SQL enables users to extract meaningful data from large datasets using simple queries.

✅ Data Manipulation
It allows easy addition, deletion, and updating of records without touching the database structure.

✅ Data Definition
Users can define new tables, set primary and foreign keys, and change existing schemas.

✅ Security and Access Control
SQL provides access control through GRANT and REVOKE commands to define user roles and permissions.

✅ Transaction Management
SQL supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure reliable transaction handling.

✅ Integration with Programming Languages
SQL can be embedded in languages like PHP, Python, Java, etc., to build full-fledged applications.

DBMS is a general system for storing data, often unstructured or semi-structured.

RDBMS is a more advanced system based on the relational model with structured storage, relationships, and powerful querying using SQL.






SQL Syntax - Basic SQL Syntax, Structure of SQL Statements
SQL Constraints - Types of Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN
KEY), Implementing Constraints in Tables
Main SQL Commands and Sub-commands - Data Definition Language (DDL), CREATE Command,
Creating Tables, Specifying Column Names, Data Types, and Constraints
ALTER Command - Modifying Existing Tables, Adding, Modifying, or Dropping Columns
DROP Command - Deleting Tables from the Database
Data Manipulation Language (DML) - INSERT Command, Adding Data into Tables Specifying
Column Names and Values
UPDATE Command - Modifying Existing Data in Tables, Changing Values in Specific Columns
DELETE Command - Removing Data from Tables, Deleting Specific Rows with WHERE Clause
Data Query Language (DQL) - SELECT Command, Retrieving Data from Tables, Filtering Data
with WHERE Clause, Sorting Data with ORDER BY Clause, Limiting Results with LIMIT or
FETCH FIRST Clause
Data Control Language (DCL) -GRANT Command, Granting Privileges to Users or Roles, Granting
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Permissions
REVOKE Command - Revoking Privileges from Users or Roles, Removing SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE, DELETE Permissions
Transaction Control Language (TCL) - COMMIT Command, Saving Changes Permanently to the
Database
ROLLBACK Command - Reverting Uncommitted Changes, ?SAVEPOINT Command - Creating
Intermediate Points in a Transaction for Rollback
SQL Joins - Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Full Outer Join
SQL Group By - Grouping Data in SQL Queries

Procedures
